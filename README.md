# sjnos-for-minecraft (discontinued)

> I worked on this project between the age of 15 and 17. It is written in Lua and uses Pastebin in its build pipeline, so expect it to be very rough around the edges.

_SJNOS_ is a sophisticated user interface for
computers in a modification of the game [Minecraft][mc]. It provides tools to manage industrial structures and helps with daily tasks.

It requires [Computercraft][cc] (v1.5+) and was designed for [Tekkit Lite][tklite].

Main Features:

- Desktop-like User Interface
- Utilities for managing Electricity (Redstone)
- Utilities for Computercraft: GPS, Printers, Monitors, Disk Drives
- File Explorer and Terminal
- Internet-like Server/Client Communication, Web-Browser, File Transfer
